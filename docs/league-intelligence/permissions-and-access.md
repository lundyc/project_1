# Permissions and Access

## Platform Roles

- **Platform Admin**: Full access to all League Intelligence features (view, manage, configure).
- **Club Admin**: No access during development; future read-only access may be considered.
- **General User**: No access.

## Access Policy

- **League Intelligence is platform-level**: Data and analytics are not club-owned and are managed centrally.
- **During development**: Only platform admins can view or interact with League Intelligence.
- **Future expansion**: Role-based access may be extended to league managers or read-only club access.

## Rationale

- Ensures data integrity and consistency across the platform.
- Prevents club-level bias or manipulation of league analytics.
- Supports league-wide decision-making and transparency.

## Future Considerations

- Read-only access for club admins and league officials.
- Custom roles for analytics, reporting, or competition management.
- Audit trails for any manual data adjustments.
