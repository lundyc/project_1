# PHASE 0 – UI Refactor Scope & Guardrails

## In Scope
- Desktop UI only
- All pages EXCEPT `/matches/{id}/desk`
- Layout, spacing, colours, typography, component consistency

## Out of Scope
- Mobile responsiveness
- Tablet layouts
- Match desk UI
- Feature changes or new functionality

## Rules
- Tailwind-first styling
- No new one-off CSS unless absolutely unavoidable
- Reusable components only (no page-specific hacks)
- Visual consistency > personal preference
